If you want to generate DBN, you have to download Banjo software, developed by Prof. Alexander J. Hartemink, Duke University, from this link:
 https://www.cs.duke.edu/~amink/software/banjo/

But, you need update two files in this folder ModifiedBanjo-Extra: 

PostProcessor.java
SLUGene.java

modified by Jakob Klinger and Kevin Damazyn in Dr. Gongâ€™s group.

The Banjo based on these two modified files can generate multiple networks with SMV verification code.

You will need install SMV model checker to run the SMV code, developed by McMillan from this link
